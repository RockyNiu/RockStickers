An Android app for gathering links. 

The original requirement came from My Mother in Law. She wanted an android app she could be easily to watch some special TV programs. 

Unfortunately, there is no app meet her simple requirement, as you know, too complicated apps are not suitable for olders.

I spend around three hours, and made the v1.0.0 to just show one most important link for her, the app has SQL database supporting and dismiss function. 

More time will be spend to make both lists and items editable.
